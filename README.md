#Intro
Hi, my name is **Pavlo Triantafyllides**. I am an undergraduate computer engineering student from Clemson University. You may notice that many of my repos lack README files, this is because I never intended to publish allot of this work. But, people have started asking for my github account, so I need to make my source control look more presentable. I was planning on going through and adding README files to all my repos, but, until i get to that, I will just start including them in new repos, like this one! :+1:

#Project Description
This is a brief exercise in sending email with python. The purpose of the **sendEmail.py** script is to email all of my professors simultaneously, asking for leniancy in regards to my upcoming absences. The **infoclear.py** script was used to remove all personal information (aside from my name) from the SendEmail.py script. These scripts should be run using Python 3.
